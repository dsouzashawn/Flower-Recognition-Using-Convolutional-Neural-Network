Purpose: The purpose of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as building type, lot size, year built, etc. This can help buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about real estate transactions.

Concepts Used: This project involves concepts of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, one-hot encoding for categorical features, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training machine learning models for regression tasks.

Machine Learning Topic: This project focuses on regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous values (i.e., house prices) based on input features. The regression models used include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, and CatBoost Regression.

Tech Stack Used: The project utilizes the following libraries and tools:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
CatBoost: For gradient boosting-based regression.
How the Project Works:

Data Importing: The dataset containing information about house prices and features is imported using Pandas.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to visualize the data distribution, correlation between features, and unique values of categorical features.
Data Cleaning: Data cleaning involves removing or imputing missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.
Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest Regression
